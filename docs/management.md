## Data Collection & Management

### Longitudinal Data Capture (Capture App)

The **Tracker Capture App** in PropaData is used to register **participants** and follow them through  activities and records that happen at a specific **Program** and **Organisation Unit** across different program stages. 

![Capture app](images/image44.png)

#### Managing Participants (Tracked Entity Instances)
The key program participants are treated as **tracked entities**, which allows program officers to search, register, and update participant information.

##### Searching for an Existing Participant

- Always **search before registering a new participant** to avoid duplicates.  
- You can search using attributes such as **phone number, name, or trader ID**.  
- If the participant already exists, the system will redirect you to their **dashboard**.  

![Search for a participant](images/image-202.png)

##### Registering a New Participant and Capturing Attributes
If the participant does not exist, you can **register them as new participants**. By filling in all mandatory attributes (marked with an asterisk `*`), such as, **Name**, **Gender**, **Phone number**  and the **Organisation Unit (Ward)**  

![Register a participant](images/image-203.png)

Once saved, the participant is added to the program as a tracked entity. 

##### Updating Program Records  

If a participant already exists you can **update their records** directly from their **dashboard** and in addition, participants can be **enrolled into new programs** (if not already enrolled) and data can be captured for the relevant program stages.  

![Participant dashboard](images/image205.png)  

#### Data Quality and Audit  
To ensure transparency and accountability, every change made to a participantâ€™s record is stored in the **audit trail**.  
The audit trail captures:  

- **User** â€“ who made the change  
- **Data item** â€“ the specific field or record updated  
- **Timestamp** â€“ the exact date and time of the change  

![Audit trail](images/image206.png)



### Aggregate Data Capture (Data Entry App)

The **Data Entry app** in PropaData is used to capture **aggregate information**.  
Aggregate data refers to information collected at a **group level** (i.e, ward, sub-county, county) rather than for a single individual.  

* Some key Features of the Data Entry include:

    - **Organisation Unit Selection**  
        - Choose your ward (or higher level if authorised) before entering data.  

    - **Dataset Selection**  
        - Different datasets represent different forms, e.g., *Trader Onboarding*, *Survey Completion* or *Activities Report*.  

    - **Period Selection**  
         - Enter data for a specific reporting period (weekly, monthly or quarterly, depending on the dataset).  

    - **Forms**  
          - Data entry forms may include numbers, yes/no fields or options. Required fields are highlighted.  

    - **Validation**  
         - Before saving, the system checks your entries (i.e., missing or invalid values).  

    - **Save & Complete**  
          - Use **Save** if youâ€™re still working on the form.  
          - Use **Complete** when all data is filled in correctly. Completed forms lock the period for that dataset.  

    - **Details**  
        - Either View or Hide details
        - View details - to view various details about the data set and also the forms audit logs.


![Data entry app](images/image43.png)

##### Data Set Selection
Choose the **data set** you are reporting on which is a collection of data elements(e.g., Monthly Fish Sales, Training Attendance).  
This are data sets with selected data elements for the specific data collection.

##### Selecting the Organisation Unit
From the organisation unit tree, select your reporting unit (e.g., Country).  

##### Selecting the Reporting Period
Specify the reporting period (e.g., month, quarter, or year) depending on the dataset requirements.  
The available periods are controlled by the period type of the data set (reporting frequency). You can jump a year back or forward by clicking Prev year or Next year.



#### Data Entry Process
##### Entering Data into the Form
- Fill in the values directly into the form fields.  
- Mandatory fields are highlighted and must be completed.  

> A **green** field means that the system has saved the value.

> A **grey** field means that the field is disabled and you can't enter a value. The cursor will automatically jump to the next open field.

- If you type in an invalid value, for example a character in a field that only accepts numeric values, you'll get a pop-up that explains the problem and the field will be coloured **yellow** (not saved) until you have corrected the value.

- If you have defined a minimum maximum value range for the field and you enter a value that is outside this range, you'll get a pop-up message that says the value is out of range. The value remains unsaved until you've changed the value or updated the value range and then re-entered the value.

* Comments can be added to individual data values for clarification.  

##### Data Validation Rules 
- Validation rules check for **consistency and accuracy** of entered data. 
- When you've filled in the form, click Run validation in the top right corner or below the data entry form to check against the set rules (Validation Rules) for the data set.

##### Comments for Data Values 
- Comments can be added to individual data values for clarification.  
- This is useful for explaining anomalies (e.g., unusually high sales due to a local festival).  

#### Data Submission
##### Validation Checks
- Before submission, run **validation checks** to ensure all data entered is correct and complete. 

##### Mark Data Set as Complete
- Once validated, mark the dataset as **Complete** to signal final submission.  

##### Viewing the Audit Trail for a Data Set

The audit trail provides a record of:  
- Who entered or modified data  
- What was changed  
- The exact timestamp of each change  

![audit trail](images/image207.png)


> ðŸ”‘ **Important:** All aggregate data (registrations, surveys, activities) must be entered under your **assigned ward**. This ensures that reporting and dashboards reflect the correct geographic location.
